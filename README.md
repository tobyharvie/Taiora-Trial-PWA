# Taiora-Trial-PWA

In 2022, I built a Progressive Web App for use in surveying teenage participants in a clinical trial on mental health. Whilst a Wordpress website was currently being used, the research manager wanted to integrate an app in order to increase engagement with their teenage participants. With the inability to simply transform the Wordpress site to a PWA, what instead resulted was a building from scratch a separate PWA, an extensive project with extensive technical challenges. These included somehow fetching and integrating the native Wordpress form components - a definite puzzle in deciphering undocumented codebases. I submitted a [report](/Taiora-Trial-PWA-Report) of this as a NZQA Scholarship Technology project and recieved an Outstanding Award - the top mark in the country achieved by only 9 others. Unfortunately, due to changes in the running of the trial and ongoing issues with Wordpress, the project did not reach deployment.

Please see the report for an extensive discussion of my process and the challenges faced.
